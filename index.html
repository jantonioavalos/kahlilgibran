        <blockquote class="copytext text-top" cite="http://gibrankgibran.org/eng/gibran-kahlil-gibran/notas-biograficas/">Born to Kahlil Saad Gibran and Kamileh Rahme, Gibran Kahlil Gibran was raised, along with his sisters Marianna and Sultana and his half-brother Boutros, in the bosom of a Lebanese Maronite Christian family. </br><strong>Around 1891,</strong> Kahlil
          Gibran’s father was arrested on charges of improperly administering the funds he collected. Following his release, and in the wake of economic crises befalling the family, Kamileh decided to emigrate with her children to America. </br><strong>In 1895</strong>          the family arrived in New York before continuing on to Boston. There, Kamileh and her children supported themselves with a small grocery store. Gibran’s teacher, Florence Pierce, placed the young man under the tutelage of the sybarite and photographer
          Fred Holland Day, who would become a dear friend and one of the greatest influences on the life of the future artist. Day introduced Gibran into Boston intellectual and bohemian circles. It was also owing to Day that Gibran became acquainted
          with the art of William Blake (1957-1827) and Eugène Carrière (1849-1906), who would later have an impact on his symbolist works. </br><strong>Around 1898,</strong> Gibran returned to Lebanon and studied under Youssef Haddad, his most important
          teacher. He returned to Boston on the death of Sultana, which was followed by the illnesses and subsequent deaths of Boutros and Kamileh. </br> Through the mediation of Fred Holland Day, Gibran exhibited his first paintings in 1904, at the Harcourt
          Studios in Boston, where he met Mary Haskell, who would become his great friend, patroness, and companion for the rest of his life. The following year he published, in Arabic, his first book: <em>Music</em>. <br><a href="http://gibrankgibran.org/eng/gibran-kahlil-gibran/notas-biograficas/"

                <br>A young Kahlil is introduced to Faris Karama, a wealthy and good-hearted merchant of Beirut, and his daughter, Salma. Kahlil and Salma are deeply attracted to on another and continue to meet regularly, with the blessings of Faris Karama.
                But a powerful priest, Father Ghalib, in order to gain access to the Karama fortune, demands that his son be allowed to marry Salma.</p>
